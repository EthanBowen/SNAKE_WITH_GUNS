# SNAKE_WITH_GUNS
 A small project made solely by me (with some art assets from the internet).

The original prompt for the project was to take a classic arcade game and add 2 new features to it. I chose to do Snake. My 2 features were allowing full range of motion and adding a jump to allow the player to pass over themself. 

I later revisited the project with the idea of turning it into something of a hoard survival game. I created some basic enemies and guns and thought the end result was pretty fun.
