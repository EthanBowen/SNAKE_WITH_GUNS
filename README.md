A small project made solely by me (with some art assets from the internet).

I made this project as a part of one of my grad school classes. We made several small games over the course of one semester. For the final project we had to revisit and expand one of the projects we had done. I chose to go all the way back to the first project since I had the most freedom with that one and felt it had a solid foundation. I did write ups for each of these projects and developed my documentation style and vocabulary quite a bit between projects.

The original prompt for the project was to take a classic arcade game and add 2 new features to it. I chose to do Snake. My 2 features were allowing full range of motion and adding a jump to allow the player to pass over themself. 

I later revisited the project with the idea of turning it into something of a horde survival game. I created some basic enemies and guns and thought the end result was pretty fun!
